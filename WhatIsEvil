Haixiang: Socretes and Plato believed that the true evil is ignorance. To love someone is to better them. Therefore they devoted their life to educate the citizens of Athens. From from glance it maybe far fetched, but how often we make the wrong choices in life because our faulty logic leads to probmatic rationalization of our actions, or uneducated in process misinformation (just think about how we are processing information from internet or from politations nowadays, and how easily we take them as truth). Is evil ignorance? or even related to ignorance? Alternatively if we are better educated in logic and to better process the informations feeded to us, will we become better (to be defined).
