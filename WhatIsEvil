Haixiang: Socretes and Plato believed that the true evil is ignorance. To love someone is to better them. Therefore they devoted their life to educate the citizens of Athens. From from glance it maybe far fetched, but how often we make the wrong choices in life because our faulty logic leads to probmatic rationalization of our actions, or uneducated in process misinformation (just think about how we are processing information from internet or from politations nowadays, and how easily we take them as truth). Is evil ignorance? or even related to ignorance? Alternatively if we are better educated in logic and to better process the informations feeded to us, will we become better (to be defined).
JT: I think true evil is evil, haha.  Evil is sinning. I say that because even if people have a perfect understanding about God/what they're supposed to do, they can still choose not to do it.  People also do stuff they know is wrong.  That's not really ignorance.  Logic is really just a tool we can use.  You can use logic to try to convince yourself/other people that things are good or bad.  The reason for that is you can assume faulty premises (either on purpose or not) to reach faulty logical conclusions.
Haixiang: So, this is related to the our conversation in the "Goodness Of Action". If we agree on that if all people only do what is good to their own understanding of what good is. Then the reason people do not do what is good is because the ignorance of what true good is. I think yes, people would do what they know that has downsides. But I would not agree that they truly believe that such action is wrong. But simply that those actions have some goodness and some badness. And though recognized the badness in their action, they consider the goodness trumps the badness. So, the outcome is that they have choosen what is the better option to their value system. 
[NOTE] (Given that this is close to the discussion of "Goodness Of Action", we can merge them)
