Haixiang: A statement: All people, only do things they think is good. Is this statement true? Or false?

JT: False.  A counter-example: I've done things I think are wrong.  Just because someone knows something is wrong, doesn't mean they can't be overcome by their desire to do it.

Haixiang: So, what do you mean by wrong? Do you mean wrong as there is absolutely no perceivable benifit of the action? Or there are both perceivable benifits (either emotional or rational) and perceivable drawbacks and *at the moment* you have decided the benifit overcomes the drawbacks? If so, I would still say that you have done something that you think is good, even though may not be purely good.

Haixiang: {Reference: Socrotes believes that "No one does evil willingly." This maybe a better phrase of the problem. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_intellectualism]}
