Haixiang Liu: Should we do anything that God would not do?

JT: We shouldn't do anyting God would not want us to do.

Haixiang Liu: I would certainly agree with your statement (though in many cases it is very vague what god would not want us to do. And many solutions proposed by Pual is tailor towards specific situation of each church given their culture and history. So, though it is forbidden in the bible, many people would argue that no longer apply to us given the different context we live in). But what about my statement? Should we do anything that God would not do?
